Here's a step-by-step guide for setting up and using Eclipse Mosquitto as a broker and MQTT Explorer as a client:

Step 1: Download and Install Software
1. Download Eclipse Mosquitto: from the official website: [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/download/).
2. Install Eclipse Mosquitto: following the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Download MQTT Explorer: from the official website: [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/).
4. Install MQTT Explorer: following the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Configure and Run Mosquitto Broker
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd).
2. Start Mosquitto Broker by typing:
  
   mosquitto -v
  

Step 3: Configure Firewall (if necessary)
1. Open Firewall settings on your computer.
2. Create a new rule to allow traffic through port 1883.

Step 4: Publish a Message
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd).
2. Publish a messagE using the following command:
   
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t topic/pub -m "YOUR MESSAGE" -r -i client -d
  
   -h localhost specifies the broker's address.
   -t topic/pub specifies the topic.
   -m "YOUR MESSAGE" specifies the message.
   -r makes the message retained.
   -i client sets the client ID.
   -d enables debug mode.



Step 5: Subscribe to a Topic
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd).
2. Subscribe to a topic** using the following command:

   mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t topic/# -d

   -h localhost specifies the broker's address.
   -t topic/# specifies the topic (the `#` is a wildcard for all sub-topics).
   -d enables debug mode.

Step 6: Use MQTT Explorer as a Client
1. Open MQTT Explorer.
2. Configure connection settings:
   - Host: 127.0.0.1
   - Port: 1883
3. Connect to the broker.

Step 7: Send and Receive Messages
1. Send a message from MQTT Explorer by publishing to `topic/pub`.
2. Receive the message in the Command Prompt where you subscribed.

For Using Network IPv4 Address
Create a Configuration File:

Open Notepad.
Type the following:

listener 1883
allow_anonymous true

Save the file with the extension .conf (e.g., test.conf) in the same location where Mosquitto is installed.
Run Mosquitto with Configuration File:

Open Command Prompt (cmd).
Start Mosquitto with the configuration file by typing:

mosquitto -v -c test.conf

### Example Usage
1.Publish a message using:
   
   	mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t topic/pub -m "Hello from cmd" -r -i client -d
  In case of using ipv4 address:
	mosquitto_pub -h ("YOUR IPV4 ADDRESS") -t topic/pub -m "Hello from cmd" -r -i client -d
  
2.Subscribe to a topic:

   	mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t topic/# -d
  In case of using ipv4 address:
	mosquitto_pub -h ("YOUR IPV4 ADDRESS") -t topic/# -d

3.Send a message from MQTT Explorer:
   - Topic: topic/pub
   - Message: Hi this is client

4.bserve the message in Command Prompt where you subscribed.
